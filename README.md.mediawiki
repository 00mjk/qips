==QRL improvement proposals (QIPS) ==

Following mainnet-launch, any significant design changes must pass through a QIP process, prior to being implemented in release code. We are a friendly bunch and likely to approve useful and innovative suggestions. 

A template mediawiki file inherited from the BIP process can be found in this repo and may be used as a template upon which to document a proposal.

Please discuss your improvement ideas with the team prior to submitting here as a fully formed QIP proposal. We look forward to your suggestions.
